    ----------
    output_queues: list[Queue]
        The list of reducer queues
    num_reducer_processes: int
        The number of reducing processes (the size of the output_queues list)

        The mapper process is given a directory to use as a source of data

    Methods
    -------

        a stream of mapped key-count pairs are sent to the target reducer
    hash_word:
        Determines the target reducer based on the hash of the word
